# Lab02-ATM  
A C# ATM application that uses TDD to check that it's working.  
![.NET Core](https://github.com/OCDAmmo3/Lab02-ATM/workflows/.NET%20Core/badge.svg)  

This application has many possible methods to use inside of it.  
  
### Withdraw(amount);  
Withdraws a certain amount of money, returning that withdrawn amount to the user, as well as the remaining balance.  
  
### Deposit(amount);  
Deposits a certain amount of money, returning the new balance to the user.
  
### ViewBalance();  
Returns the current balance to the user.  
  
### TransHistory();
Returns the history of transactions as strings.  
  
  
  
This lab took me roughly 2.5 hours to complete.  
  
There are tests for each and every method, aside from TransHistory. Tests may be impleted with such over the coming days.
